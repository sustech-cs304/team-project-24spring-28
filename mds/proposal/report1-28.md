## Part III. AI Usage

***THIS PART should be done by WYR***

Our group comes up with the features, requirements, user stories, issues and tasks on our own, without AI assistance.

As the proposal requires, we try using AI to generate those contents and compare them with our works.

### Experiments

**AI we used: Github Copilot** (based on GPT-3.5)

### Have you used AI to propose features for the project?

#### Prompt:

propose features for the project: Please design and implement a "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system, in which users can view information for SUSTech performances (e.g., musical concerts), distinguish lectures (e.g., by Turing Award recipients), competitions (football match, coding skill competitions), and other events. Users could also book tickets, make reservations, or write reviews. Specifically, Users can explore specific information about various events, including categories, maps, venues, etc. Users can make reservations, book seats, and purchase tickets for various events. The system also supports user reviews, communication, assistance, and (real-time) information sharing (e.g., video clips, pictures, etc.) for events and activities The system can provide event recommendations

#### Response:

Here are some proposed features for the "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system:

1. **Event Browsing**: Users can browse information about various events, including musical concerts, lectures, competitions, etc. Detailed information about each event including categories, maps, venues, etc. should be available.
2. **Event Booking**: Users can make reservations, book seats, and purchase tickets for various events.
3. **User Reviews**: Users can write reviews for the events they have attended, sharing their experiences and impressions.
4. **Real-time Information Sharing**: Users can share real-time information about events, such as video clips, pictures, etc.
5. **User Communication**: Provide a platform for users to communicate their views and feelings about the events, as well as provide help and suggestions.
6. **Event Recommendations**: The system can recommend events that users may be interested in based on their behavior and preferences.
7. **User Account Management**: Users can create and manage their accounts, including viewing booking history, managing personal information, etc.
8. **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for specific events and filter results based on categories, dates, locations, etc.
9. **Notifications and Reminders**: The system can send notifications and reminders when the events booked by users are about to start.
10. **Mobile Device Support**: The system should support various mobile devices so that users can view event information and make bookings anywhere.

These features should meet the needs of most users for the "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system. However, adjustments may be needed based on user feedback and business requirements during the actual development process.



### Have you used AI to conduct the preliminary requirement analysis (e.g., identify functional and non functional requirements)?

#### Prompt:

please identify functional and non functional requirements

#### Response:

Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do. They describe the behavior of the system under certain conditions. For the "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system, the functional requirements could include:

1. **Event Browsing**: The system should allow users to browse various events.
2. **Event Booking**: The system should allow users to make reservations, book seats, and purchase tickets.
3. **User Reviews**: The system should allow users to write and view reviews for events.
4. **Real-time Information Sharing**: The system should allow users to share real-time information about events.
5. **User Communication**: The system should provide a platform for users to communicate about events.
6. **Event Recommendations**: The system should recommend events based on user behavior and preferences.
7. **User Account Management**: The system should allow users to create and manage their accounts.
8. **Search and Filtering**: The system should allow users to search for events and filter results.
9. **Notifications and Reminders**: The system should send notifications and reminders to users.

Non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. They describe the system's properties or characteristics. For the "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system, the non-functional requirements could include:

User stories are a simple way to capture user requirements throughout a project. Here are some user stories for the "Campus Events and Entertainment Center" system:

1. As a user, I want to browse various events so that I can see what's happening on campus.
2. As a user, I want to view detailed information about each event, including categories, maps, and venues, so that I can decide whether to attend.
3. As a user, I want to make reservations, book seats, and purchase tickets for events so that I can secure my participation.
4. As a user, I want to write reviews for events I have attended so that I can share my experiences and impressions.
5. As a user, I want to share real-time information about events, such as video clips and pictures, so that others can see what's happening.
6. As a user, I want to communicate with other users about events so that I can share views and feelings.
7. As a user, I want to receive event recommendations based on my behavior and preferences so that I can discover events I might be interested in.
8. As a user, I want to create and manage my account so that I can view my booking history and manage my personal information.
9. As a user, I want to search for specific events and filter results based on categories, dates, locations, etc., so that I can find events that meet my criteria.
10. As a user, I want to receive notifications and reminders when the events I booked are about to start so that I don't miss them.
